    "You have two options for completing your final project for this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1 ####\n",
    "The first option is presented in this notebook and involves implementing a Connect Four game with AB pruning and A* as player strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2 ####\n",
    "The second option is to design your own project that includes any of the algorithms we've discussed throughout the semester, or an algorithm that you're interested in learning that we haven't discussed in class. Your project also needs to include some kind of analysis of how it performed on a specific problem. If you're interested in the design your own project option, you need to discuss your idea with one of the course instructors to get approval. If you do a project without getting approval, you will receive a 0 regardless of the quality of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose EITHER the given problem to submit OR choose your own project topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you choose your own project topic, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "- Send an email to the course instructors before Friday, November 18 at 6pm, with a paragraph description of your project. We will respond within 24 hours with feedback.\n",
    "- The project can include an algorithm we've discussed throughout the semester or an algorithm that you're been curious to learn. Please don't recycle a project that you did in another class. \n",
    "- If you do your own project without prior approval, you will receive a 0 for this project.\n",
    "- Your project code, explanation, and results must all be contained in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "4. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbook, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python. You may not use entire segments of code as solutions to any part of this project, e.g. if you find a Python implementation of policy iteration online, you can't use it.\n",
    "5. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "7. This is meant to be like a coding portion of an exam. So, we will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "8. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If we decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then we will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "9. If any part of the given project or your personal project is left open-ended, it is because we intend for you to code it up however you want. Our primary concern is with the plots/analysis that your code produces. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",

    "We've provided the humble beginnings of a Connect Four game. You need to fill in this class structure for Connect Four using what we did during class as a guide, and then implement min-max search with AB pruning, and A* search with at least one heuristic function. The class structure includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `moves` is a list of columns to represent which moves are available. Recall that we are using matrix notation for this, where the upper-left corner of the board, for example, is represented at (1,1).\n",
    "* `result(self, move, state)` returns a ***hypothetical*** resulting `State` object if `move` is made when the game is in the current `state`. Note that when a 'move' is made, the column must have an open slot and the piece must drop to the lowest row. \n",
    "* `compute_utility(self, move, state)` calculates the utility of `state` that would result if `move` is made when the game is in the current `state`. This is where you want to check to see if anyone has gotten `nwin` in a row\n",
    "* `game_over(self, state)` returns `True` if the game in the given `state` has reached a terminal state, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "* `utility(self, state, player)` returns the utility of the current state if the player is Red and $-1 \\cdot$ utility if the player is Black.\n",
    "* `display(self)` is a method to display the current game `state`. You get it for free because this would be super frustrating without it.\n",
    "* `play_game(self, player1, player2)` returns an integer that is the utility of the outcome of the game (+1 if Red wins, 0 if draw, -1 if Black wins). `player1` and `player2` are functional arguments that we will deal with in parts **1b** and **1d**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "* Assume Red always goes first.\n",
    "* Do **not** hard-code for 6x7 boards.\n",
    "* You may add attributes and methods to these classes as needed for this problem."

It also eliminated the need to have a frontier queue since the variable kept track of cost. \n",

I do think that Euclidean and Manhattan distances were both covered in lecture and might let me 'feel out' how A* works instead of trusting three_in_a_row to know what it's doing, so I might practice that in my free time.
